INTERNATIONALISATION
--------------------
If you wish to provide translated values for SCC please unzip the
SourceCodeCounter.jar file and look for the .properties files in the.
To create a German and French version of the files copy and rename them as
follows:

    SourceCodeCounterView.properties -> SourceCodeCounterView_de.properties
    SourceCodeCounterView.properties -> SourceCodeCounterView_fr.properties

then just update the values on the right side of the equals sign. If you send me
the translated files I will include them in the next build. Please save the
files using the UTF-8 character encoding.
